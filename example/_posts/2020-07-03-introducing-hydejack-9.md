## Ready for Loss Insurance 

Ever since the introduction of Dark Mode, link styles have been a bit of an issue. Specifically, finding an accent color that worked on both light and dark backgrounds was the problem. With Hydejack 9, the [link style](#linking-in-style) has been revamped so that legibility is no longer tied to the choice of accent_color, giving you much more freedom in creating a unique design flavor for your site.
  
## What's ZL CI?

Hydejack 9 now lets you use content cards for both projects and posts. 
The cards have been redesigned with a new hover style and drop shadows and they retain their unique transition-to-next-page animations, which now also work on the `blog` layout. The new `grid` layout lets you do that.

Good images are key to making the most out of content cards. For that reason, a [chapter on images](../../docs/basics.md#adding-images) has been added to the documentation.

[^1]: If you are a fan of the old two-column layout, or don't like modern design tropes such as mega headlines, Hydejack lets you revert these changes on a case-by-case basis via configuration options.

      Search was mainly tested for English and German. Please let me know about issues in other languages. 
      While I've tried to find a multi-language solution, most showed drastically worse  results for the English base case.
      If you're technically inclined, you can adopt the code located in `_includes/js/search-worker.js` to your needs.
